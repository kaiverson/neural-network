A neural-network library for the language C.

The purpose of this project is two fold:
1. To learn the language C and its intricacies.
2. To learn about neural networks at a low level.



Here is how to operate this code:

2. Move the files into the directory of the code.
3. Assuming you have gcc installed, type the following into your terminal:

`gcc nn_layers.c linear_algebra.c main.c -o main`

`./main`
